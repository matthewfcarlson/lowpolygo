# lowpolygo
A golang based primitive inspired drawing

The goal of this project is to create a tool that can generate lowpoly images from a given source and output an SVG. For a proof of concept, it will be written in java. A later rewrite will be in Rust or Golang, depending on which one makes the most sense.
